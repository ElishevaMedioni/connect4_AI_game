# Connect 4 AI Game
Connect 4 programmed in python

Using minimax and alphaBetaPruning algorithms.

You can increase the level of the game by increasing the level of the depth in alphaBetaPruning.py file.

When you increase the depth, the computer calculates more states deeper in the minimax algorithm, and then it's harder to win.
