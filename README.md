# Connect 4 AI Game :joystick:
Connect 4 programmed in python

:bulb: Using minimax and alphaBetaPruning algorithms.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: You can increase the level of the game by increasing the level of the depth in alphaBetaPruning.py file.

:trophy: When you increase the depth, the computer calculates more states deeper in the minimax algorithm, and then it's harder to win.
